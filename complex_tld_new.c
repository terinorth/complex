 * We implement purge(), which calls on equil(), one final time after evolution is complete.

 * (Stoptime<=Purge_check<=Tt)
 * There may be a rare occasion when purge() doesn't initiate at the last iteration due to the finite representation of doubles:
 * (Stoptime<=Tt<=Purge_check) -->Purge_check has drifted higher than Stoptime for a Tt to be generated in between
 * We would always know when this happens because the number of plots created by purge()[equil()] will be less than Stoptime/Purge_check
 * It may also be the case that purge() initiates before the final value of Tt is generated in the simulation:
 * Purge_check<=Tt<=Stoptime...leading to...Purge_check<=Stoptime<=Tt --> Purge_check has drifted lower than Stoptime so Tt has been generated again 
 * This would lead to the last plot created by Purge_check being out of date at the end of the simulation
 * To ensure we always use the correct plots and data (trait_effects.txt) to describe the end of the simulation, we re-run purge() after evolution is complete
 * and implement ms() again in printstuff to account for the fact that a final purging of fixed alleles has taken place.
 * When checking equilbirium convergence, always substitue the "12345" file in the place of the last equil() data file, or include the "12345" file
 * if the last equil() data file is missing. This can be done manually when reviewing the plots created by complex_equil.R. complex_equil_ii.R
 * has been coded to perform this substitution. 
 * WARNING: in complex_equil_ii.r we rely on the fact that stoptime will always be exactly divisible by purge_interval. 
 * Every time we purge the fixed mutations, we also assess the sfd and other statistics within the current population using ms()/equil()
